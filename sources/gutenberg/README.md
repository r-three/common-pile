python get-pg19-books.py 28520 30360 57479 57486 38200 3189 26568 51155 38718
```

### PG Metadata says it is Copyrighted, but it is in PG19

* `1546` _Sonnets of Sundry Notes_ by William Shakespeare, originally published in The Passionate Pilgrim (1599). So it has moved into Public Domain.
* `378` _The White Knight: Tirant Lo Blanc_, originally published in 1490. So it has moved into Public Domain.

```python
python add-to-book-index.py 1546 378
```

### PG Information

Both book `10802` and `11220` include information describing the format of data on the Project Gutenberg CD's. These do not seem good for language modeling.

### Music

`5627`, `5634`,  `5635`, `4949`, `4950`, `4951`, `4749`, `4750`, `4751`, are text describing the files with music from classical composers, these say to not remove the headers/footers and do not seem to be useful for language modeling.

## Possibly Missing

* Books marked as Copyrighted, but are published before 1923, i.e., they are older than 100 years and have passed into public domain.
* Books that lack a plaintext version.
* Two of the books missing from PG but included in PG19 are erotic books, similar books may be hidden by default?
