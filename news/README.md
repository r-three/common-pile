## TODO:

Add per site filtering to urls, for example, balkandiskurs should probably have a filter that ensures the url path starts with /en/YYYY/MM/DD...

`https://globalvoices.org/2008/07/22/home/` gets filtered based on removing `/home/` from 360info. Have per site filters?

Milwaukee seems to have a lot of link that aren't from the same site.

There are a lot of pages that are just pictures for Propastop, they aren't easy to filter out.
