# Foodista

This Code scrapes the Foodista shared recipe site which is licensed under CC-BY-3.0

## Downloading the Data

1. Use `python build_index.py` to get a list of pages on the site by parsing the sitemap.
2. Use `python download_pages.py` to download the pages. `--wait` can be used to give the remote server a break between requests. `--num_threads` controls how many threads are used to download the data. This script can do incremental downloads, or it can re-download everything with the `--overwrite` flag.
3. Use `python to_dolma.py` to convert the pages from files on disk to the dolma format. Each page is raw html at this point.
4. Use `python preprocess.py` to parse the html into plain text. This uses dolma for multiprocessing of the various data shards.

You can also use `get-data.sh` to do all the steps above automatically.

Note: It is normal to see messages in the log like this when doing test runs, but it would be concerning when running the real data collection.
