Perfect for nabe (nabemono). Nabe, or hot pot, is a typical Japanese soup eaten in the colder months, and usually cooked in a pot at the table.  These popular nabe dishes may ring a bell here in the States: Sukiyaki, Shabu Shabu, Oden. While typical nabes include vegetables and fish, seafood or meat, there really is no hard fast rule as to what you can throw in.\nTonight our nabe includes the following: Copper River salmon (one small fillet for the two of us), a few large shrimp, oyster and enoki mushrooms, mizuna (Japanese mustard greens), tofu and shirataki (konyaku) noodles. The broth is as follows:\n2/3  C. mirin\n2/3 C. sake\n2/3 C. soy sauce\n1,  1/3 C. dashi\n2 T. sugar\nCook until sugar dissolves and alcohol reduces.\nServe with hot sake to make the meal complete.\nItadakimasu (let's eat)!",
