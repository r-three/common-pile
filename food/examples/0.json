I've had a Blogspot blog for several years and haven't been good about keeping up with it at all.  That's a general/personal blog, the purpose of this blog is to focus on my passion for food.  Also, I'm planning on collaborating with my partner, Sheri, to develop this more regularly.  Right now, it's not integrated into http://www.foodista.com, but will be soon.  Foodista is an experiment I've been working on for some years, so far it's basically a search engine for recipes.\nMore good stuff to come!",
